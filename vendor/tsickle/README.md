# Tsickle - TypeScript to Closure Translator

The tsickle repository is unsupported and will not be updated. It has been [officially unsupported](https://github.com/angular/tsickle/commit/3bf8d97c6bd53a920eb4f9b4d18cb584ead48e5a) since November 2022, has not seen any new commits to master since December 2023, and will be frozen starting May 2024. We generally cannot support using tsickle to integrate with Closure Compiler outside of the Google ecosystem due to the complexity of the toolchain.

This repository will remain publicly available to fork.
